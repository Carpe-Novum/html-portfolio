<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi. My name is Marthinus Schoombie. I recently started learning web development, after 
  attaining a bachelors degree in Econometrics and an Honours degree in Statistics.
</p>

<p>In my free time, I have pursued various projects involving
  machine learning techniques, such as clustering and
  classification, as well as principal component analysis. These
  projects have deepened my skills in exploratory data analysis
  and interpretation of results. My passion for big data has driven
  me to explore large datasets and extract meaningful insights.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical background, I have developed strong
  communication and instructional skills through my nine years of
  experience as a mathematics tutor at Tricky Maths, where I
  have taught students from grade 7 to grade 12. My
  responsibilities include preparing course materials, determining
  curricula, and delivering classes tailored to each studentâ€™s
  needs. This experience has refined my ability to convey
  complex ideas in an accessible manner.</p>
