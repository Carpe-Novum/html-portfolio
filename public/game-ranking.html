<h1>The Best Video Games According to Marthinus</h1>
<h2>My top 3 video games</h2>
<hr />
<h3>#1 <br /> GTA 3</h3>
<p>This is arguably the most revolutionary video game of all time. The first very fun open world video game released by Rockstar Games.
   It is a must play for everyone older than 18 :P
</p>
<h3>#2 <br /> Elden Ring</h3>
<p>Elden Ring is a master piece by From Software, perfecting the souls like genre. It is their first
   attempt of creating an open world souls game and one can see they learned from all their previous
   attempts, such as Dark Souls 3. The environments are absolutely gorgeous and one can make one's character
   with relative freedom.
</p>
<h3>#3 <br /> To be decided</h3>
<p>There are so many good games out there that I struggle to pick a third best game. In time 
   I could perhaps have made up my mind for this third best spot.
